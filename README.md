# TestLibraryTests are basic MSTest unit tests of sibling project TestLibrary.

  Sibling projects TestLibrary + TestProgram together comprise a simple functional test sequencer.
  
  National Instruments' TestStand™ & Keysight Technologies' OpenTAP™ are test sequencers; so are TestLibrary/Test/Program, except vastly simpler.
